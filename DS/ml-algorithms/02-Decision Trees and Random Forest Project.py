# # Random Forest Project 
#
# For this project we will be exploring publicly available data from [LendingClub.com](www.lendingclub.com). Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). Hopefully, as an investor you would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back. We will try to create a model that will help predict this.
#
# Lending club had a [very interesting year in 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lending_Club#2016), so let's check out some of their data and keep the context in mind. This data is from before they even went public.
#
# We will use lending data from 2007-2010 and be trying to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full. You can download the data from [here](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action) or just use the csv already provided. It's recommended you use the csv provided as it has been cleaned of NA values.
#
# Here are what the columns represent:
# * credit.policy: 1 if the customer meets the credit underwriting criteria of LendingClub.com, and 0 otherwise.
# * purpose: The purpose of the loan (takes values "credit_card", "debt_consolidation", "educational", "major_purchase", "small_business", and "all_other").
# * int.rate: The interest rate of the loan, as a proportion (a rate of 11% would be stored as 0.11). Borrowers judged by LendingClub.com to be more risky are assigned higher interest rates.
# * installment: The monthly installments owed by the borrower if the loan is funded.
# * log.annual.inc: The natural log of the self-reported annual income of the borrower.
# * dti: The debt-to-income ratio of the borrower (amount of debt divided by annual income).
# * fico: The FICO credit score of the borrower.
# * days.with.cr.line: The number of days the borrower has had a credit line.
# * revol.bal: The borrower's revolving balance (amount unpaid at the end of the credit card billing cycle).
# * revol.util: The borrower's revolving line utilization rate (the amount of the credit line used relative to total credit available).
# * inq.last.6mths: The borrower's number of inquiries by creditors in the last 6 months.
# * delinq.2yrs: The number of times the borrower had been 30+ days past due on a payment in the past 2 years.
# * pub.rec: The borrower's number of derogatory public records (bankruptcy filings, tax liens, or judgments).

# # Import Libraries
#
# **Import the usual libraries for pandas and plotting. You can import sklearn later on.**

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# ## Get the Data
#
# ** Use pandas to read loan_data.csv as a dataframe called loans.**

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# ** Check out the info(), head(), and describe() methods on loans.**

# %%

# # Exploratory Data Analysis
#
# Let's do some data visualization! We'll use seaborn and pandas built-in plotting capabilities, but feel free to use whatever library you want. Don't worry about the colors matching, just worry about getting the main idea of the plot.
#
# ** Create a histogram of two FICO distributions on top of each other, one for each credit.policy outcome.**
#
# *Note: This is pretty tricky, feel free to reference the solutions. You'll probably need one line of code for each histogram, I also recommend just using pandas built in .hist()*

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# ** Create a similar figure, except this time select by the not.fully.paid column.**

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# ** Create a countplot using seaborn showing the counts of loans by purpose, with the color hue defined by not.fully.paid. **

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# ** Let's see the trend between FICO score and interest rate. Recreate the following jointplot.**

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# ** Create the following lmplots to see if the trend differed between not.fully.paid and credit.policy. Check the documentation for lmplot() if you can't figure out how to separate it into columns.**

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# # Setting up the Data
#
# Let's get ready to set up our data for our Random Forest Classification Model!
#
# **Check loans.info() again.**

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# ## Categorical Features
#
# Notice that the **purpose** column as categorical
#
# That means we need to transform them using dummy variables so sklearn will be able to understand them. Let's do this in one clean step using pd.get_dummies.
#
# Let's show you a way of dealing with these columns that can be expanded to multiple categorical features if necessary.
#
# **Create a list of 1 element containing the string 'purpose'. Call this list cat_feats.**

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# **Now use pd.get_dummies(loans,columns=cat_feats,drop_first=True) to create a fixed larger dataframe that has new feature columns with dummy variables. Set this dataframe as final_data.**

# %%

# ## Train Test Split
#
# Now its time to split our data into a training set and a testing set!
#
# ** Use sklearn to split your data into a training set and a testing set as we've done in the past.**

# %%

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# ## Training a Decision Tree Model
#
# Let's start by training a single decision tree first!
#
# ** Import DecisionTreeClassifier**

# %%
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# %% [markdown]
# **Create an instance of DecisionTreeClassifier() called dtree and fit it to the training data.**

# %%

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# ## Predictions and Evaluation of Decision Tree
# **Create predictions from the test set and create a classification report and a confusion matrix.**

# %%

# %%

# %%

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# ## Training the Random Forest model
#
# Now its time to train our model!
#
# **Create an instance of the RandomForestClassifier class and fit it to our training data from the previous step.**

# %%

# %%

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# ## Predictions and Evaluation
#
# Let's predict off the y_test values and evaluate our model.
#
# ** Predict the class of not.fully.paid for the X_test data.**

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# **Now create a classification report from the results. Do you get anything strange or some sort of warning?**

# %%

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# **Show the Confusion Matrix for the predictions.**

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# **What performed better the random forest or the decision tree?**

# # Great Job!
